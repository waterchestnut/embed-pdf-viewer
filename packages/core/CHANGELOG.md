### Minor Changes

- [#141](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/141) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Refactored action dispatch handling in `BasePlugin`:

  - Renamed `debouncedDispatch` to **`cooldownDispatch`**, which now executes immediately if the cooldown has expired and blocks rapid repeated calls.
  - Introduced a new **`debouncedDispatch`** method that provides true debouncing: waits until no calls occur for the specified time before dispatching.
  - Added **`cancelDebouncedDispatch`** to cancel pending debounced actions.
  - Added internal `debouncedTimeouts` tracking and ensured all timeouts are cleared on `destroy`.

  This improves clarity and provides both cooldown and debounce semantics for action dispatching.
